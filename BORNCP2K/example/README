This example computes BORN charges and dielectric constants
using finite difference method for GaN wurzite.
1. First step is generation of 2x2x2 supercell with phonopy 
(in real calculations supercell should be much bigger).
$ phonopy --cp2k -d --dim="2 2 2" -c Punitcell.inp

2. Generate input files:
$ ./calc_born_cp2k.py -i Punitcell-supercell.inp -t displ -p born

3. Edit dipole.inp and polar.inp files according to your system. This is
CP2K patterns to calculate dipole moments and polarizability

4. Run make_born_dirs.sh script to put generated files in separate
directories.
$ ./make_born_dirs.sh

5. Run calculations in each directory.

6. Generate BORN file using the following command:
$ ./calc_born_cp2k.py -i Punitcell-supercell.inp -o BORN -t calc -p born
